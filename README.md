# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ...


Rails follows the "Convention over Configuration" idealology where it makes assumptions for you as best as it can and then makes decisions based on those assumptions. Rails uses the MVC architect ... I'm using rails to demonstrate this process by making a blog site and then turning it into a vlog site.

The primary goal is to follow the rails guide in creating a blog site
The secondary goal is to give the site video blogging capabilities
The tirchiary goal is go style it in a modern way without the use of Bootstrap or Materialize
